  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary
  system: the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages.  Now
  that all circular dependencies have been resolved and the temporary system
  is already bootable, we can boot it on the target machine and it would be
  completely isolated from the host operating system.  Then we can continue
  to build on the target machine.</para>

  <para>For proper operation of the temporary system, some communication
  with the running kernel must be established. This is done through the
  so-called <emphasis>Virtual Kernel File Systems</emphasis>, which must be
  mounted as soon as possible after boot. You may want to check
  that they are mounted by issuing <command>mount</command>.</para>

  <para>All commands in this and following chapters are run as root on the
  target system, fortunately without access to the host system.
  Be careful anyway, as if the storage devices of your target system already
  contain some important data, it's possible to destroy them with badly
  formed commands.</para>
