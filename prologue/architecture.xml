  <title>LFS Target Architectures</title>

<para>The target architectures of this LFS edition are ARM64 (sometimes
called AArch64) CPUs.  On the other hand, the instructions in this book may
work on 32-bit ARM CPUs with some modifications. To build a system that
utilizes one of these CPUs, the main prerequisite, in addition to those on
the next page, is an existing Linux system such as an earlier LFS
installation, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or other distribution that
targets the architecture that you have.</para>

<para>The build results from this LFS edition is considered a
<quote>pure</quote> 64-bit system.  That is, it supports 64-bit executables
only.  Building a <quote>multi-lib</quote> system requires compiling many
applications twice, once for a 32-bit system and once for a 64-bit system.
This is not directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the
educational objective of providing the instructions needed for a
straightforward base Linux system. Some LFS/BLFS editors maintain a fork
of LFS for multilib, which is accessible at <ulink
url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html"/>. But
the multilib edition is for x86_64, and multilib is an advanced topic
anyway.</para>
