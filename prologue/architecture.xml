  <title>LFS Target Architectures</title>

<para>The primary target architectures of this LFS edition are LoongArch
CPUs.
<!--On the other hand, the instructions in this book are
also known to work, with some modifications, with the Power PC and ARM
CPUs. -->
To build a system that utilizes one of these CPUs, the main prerequisite, in
addition to those on the next page, is an existing Linux system such as an
earlier LFS installation, Loong Arch Linux, CLFS for LoongArch, Gentoo,
Slackware, or other distribution that targets LoongArch.</para>

<para>The build that results from this LFS edition is a
<quote>pure</quote> lp64d system. That is, it supports executables with
the lp64d ABI
only. Building a <quote>multi-lib</quote> system requires compiling many
applications multiple times, once for each ABI to be supported.
This is not directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the
educational objective of providing the minimal instructions needed for a
basic Linux system. Some of the LFS/BLFS editors maintain a multilib fork
of LFS, accessible at <ulink
url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html"/>. But
the multilib edition is for x86_64, and multilib is an advanced topic
anyway.</para>
